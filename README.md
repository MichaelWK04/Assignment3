# CourseWebsite
CourseWebsite is a modern take on an [old website](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~bretscher/b20/) for a class offered at the University of Toronto.

We've implemented a clean and modern design with features that improve the user experience, including responsiveness and an improved navigation. In addition, we've also implemented back end functionalities using Python Flask, allowing an entire class to be managed in this single website.

### New features include:
- Student and Teacher Login/Signup using Flask-bcrypt for password encryption
- Sessions
- Students can view their own grades
- Students can send feedback anonymously
- Teachers can post grades
- Teachers can view anonymous feedback
